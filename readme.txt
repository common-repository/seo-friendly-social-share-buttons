====== ======

This plugin does not use any Javascript code or other scripts that need external sources.
Therefore we do not lose any pagespeed when using these buttons. It's an easy way to keep
the website load very fast and can help us rank higher in search engine results. 

We can adjust the settings for this plugin in the 'settings' menu of your Wordpress installation.
There we can either chose to add the seo friendly social share buttons to a page or post, or both.
